//! BaseTransportSurface serves as the foundation for all material transport surfaces in industrial automation simulations.
//! This abstract base class provides the core infrastructure for conveyor belts, roller tables, guided transport systems,
//! and other material handling surfaces that move objects through production lines and logistics systems.
//! All transport surfaces inherit from this class to ensure consistent behavior, physics integration, and visual representation
//! across different transport mechanisms used in factory automation and intralogistics applications.
